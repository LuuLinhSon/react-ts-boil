## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
Before start, make sure you create a `.env` file and copy content of `.env.development` to `.env` file and feel free to modify that
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

### Build app for specific environment

```

```
npm run build:qc
```

```
npm run build:qa
```

```

```


### `npm run test`
There are some commands for the jest test:
#### generate code coverage
```
npm run test:coverage
```

#### open code coverage report
